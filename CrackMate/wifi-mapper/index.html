      <h2>Welcome to CrackMate</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>CrackMate</strong> is a university project developed to analyze the security of WiFi networks within an
        urban environment.
        The system performs real-time scanning of wireless access points, captures handshake data where possible, and
        uses cracking techniques
        to determine the vulnerability level of each network.
      </p>

      <p>
        Detected networks are displayed on an <strong>interactive map</strong> with color-coded markers:
        <span class="color-green">Green</span> for networks that were scanned (secure networks);
        <span class="color-orange">Orange</span> for networks where a handshake was captured but the password was not obtained;
        <span class="color-red">Red</span> for networks were the handshake was captured and the password cracked.
        Each marker includes detailed information such as BSSID, SSID, signal strength, channel, encryption type, and
        GPS location.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool is powered by several technologies:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Python (subprocess)</strong>: executes system-level commands (e.g., <code>airodump-ng</code>,
          <code>aireplay-ng</code>)</li>
        <li><strong>ADB</strong>: used to obtain GPS coordinates from a connected Android device during handshake
          capture</li>
        <li><strong>Tkinter</strong>: used to create the GUI of the application</li>
        <li><strong>HTML/CSS/Javascript</strong>: used for the creation of this website, the map and the charts</li>
        <li><strong>SQLite</strong>: used as database for storing and retriving data about the networks</li>
        <li><strong>JSON</strong>: used to convert the database information for the website</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Captured data is stored in a CSV file (<code>wifi_data.csv</code>) containing fields such as BSSID, SSID, signal
        power, channel, encryption type,
        latitude and longitude. If the GPS position was obtained during the handshake capture phase, a
        <code>LocationSource</code> column is added
        with the value <code>"HandshakeCapture"</code> for that network.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the cracking phase, the tool attempts a dictionary-based attack on each captured handshake to determine
        if the password can be retrieved.
        Results are then aggregated in the statistics page, showing encryption trends, number of networks analyzed, and
        crack success rate.
      </p>

        wireless security,
        encourage the adoption of modern encryption standards like WPA3, and highlight the risks of using outdated
        protection mechanisms.
